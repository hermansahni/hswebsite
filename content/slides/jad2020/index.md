#### Literature

Infrastructure Quality Index

_Ranking_

- No African country in the top 20
- Highest ranked:
-- Rwanda (40), Seychelles (41), Morocco (42), Namibia (45), Mauritius (50)
- 14 African countries ranked in the bottom 20

#### Literature (cont'd.)

Infrastructure Quality Index

_Electricity Issues_

- Frequent power outages, restricting access to electricity to a third of Africaâ€™s
population, reducing its productivity by as much as 40%, and curtailing its
annual economic growth by about 2% ([PIDA, 2014](https://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/programme-for-infrastructure-development-in-africa-pida))
- Only 30% of African countries have access to electricity relative to 70%-90% of other developing countries

#### Motivation 

Infrastructure & Growth

* Well-designed infrastructure investments (Energy, transport, digital communications, waste disposal networks, and water and sanitation facilities) have long-term economic benefits
    * Infrastructure raise productivity, decrease transportation and communication costs, increase land values, improve health
    * Cause significant positive spillovers.

---

#### Motivation (cont'd.)

Infrastructure & Growth

* However, investing wisely in infrastructure is critically important
    * Over-investment can lead to inefficiency and low marginal returns

---

#### Link between Infrastructure and Growth 

* Channels through which infrastructure impacts growth
    * direct input into the production process
    * complement to other inputs into the production process
    * stimulant to factor accumulation by providing facilities for human development
    * tool to guide industrial policy ([Wolassa, 2012](https://ideas.repec.org/p/adb/adbwps/438.html)).

## Code Highlighting

Inline code: `variable`

Code block:
```python
porridge = "blueberry"
if porridge == "blueberry":
    print("Eating...")
```

---

## Math

In-line math: $x + y = z$

Block math:

$$
f\left( x \right) = \;\frac{{2\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x - 4} \right)}}{{\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right)}}
$$

## Fragments

Make content appear incrementally

```
{{%/* fragment */%}} One {{%/* /fragment */%}}
{{%/* fragment */%}} **Two** {{%/* /fragment */%}}
{{%/* fragment */%}} Three {{%/* /fragment */%}}
```

Press `Space` to play!

{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}

---

A fragment can accept two optional parameters:

- `class`: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS)
- `weight`: sets the order in which a fragment appears

---

## Speaker Notes

```markdown
{{%/* speaker_note */%}}
- Only the speaker can read these notes
- Press `S` key to view
{{%/* /speaker_note */%}}
```
