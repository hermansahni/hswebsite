 abstract = {Using a sample of 18,201 observations of working age respondents drawn from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1996–2018, this research examined the labor supply efects for younger family members of living with older persons needing assistance with activities of daily living. We report the effects for three labor supply outcomes of younger family members: working hours, full-time work, and occupational fexibility of working hours. Our results indicate that living with an older family member needing assistance signifcantly reduced younger women’s working hours and the probability of working full-time among younger women, but increased both of these labor outcomes among younger men. In addition, living with an older family member needing help led younger women to work in occupations with signifcantly larger average variances in working hours. This suggests that these women occupied positions that allowed greater fexibility of working hours. We found little efect on fexibility of working hours for younger men. We conclude that the need for assistance among older family members has important efects on the labor market outcomes of younger family members}
